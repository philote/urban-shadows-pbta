### An unofficial Urban Shadows 2E module for Foundry VTT using the PbtA System

[Urban Shadows 2e](https://magpiegames.com/collections/urban-shadows) is a political urban fantasy tabletop roleplaying game where players take on the roles of powerful, supernatural beings navigating the gritty struggles of modern city life. Set in a world where vampires, mages, fae, and mortals coexist in uneasy balance, the game focuses on power, corruption, and the complex web of alliances and betrayals that shape urban communities. Built on the [Powered by the Apocalypse](http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta/games/find) system, it emphasizes narrative-driven play, character growth through tough choices, and the consequences of wielding influence in a city that always demands something in return.

The ideas used in this module are from Urban Shadows 2E from Magpie Games. You can get the Book at: https://magpiegames.com/collections/urban-shadows

This module is for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) and requires the [PbtA System](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/pbta) created by [asacolips](https://github.com/asacolips).

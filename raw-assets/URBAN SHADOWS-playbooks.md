URBAN SHADOWS
=============

Character Playbooks

The Aware
=========

Most people have no idea what takes place in the shadows of the city, remaining ignorant of the monsters that walk among us. Those awakened to the world as it truly is can't help but feel the pull of the darkness...

Aware Moves
-----------

**CHOOSE THREE:**

I Know a Guy

When you hit the streets to get what you need from a member of your Circle, roll with Heart instead of their Circle. On a 7-9, add this option to the list:

*   however you find them requires you to offer a Debt to an intermediary

Charming, Not Sincere

Take +1 Heart (max+3).

The Lion's Den

When you gain access to a secure area within a sanctuary, gathering spot, or place of power, you can study it as if you rolled a 10+. If the location is controlled by a Circle other than your own, you also find incriminating evidence implicating a powerful NPC (your choice) within that Circle; handing the documents over to them—or one of their enemies—counts as cashing in a Debt.

This is My City

When you set up a meeting with a powerful or dangerous individual in a crowded mundane space (museum, restaurant, etc.), hold 2. You can spend your hold, 1 for 1, to:

*   create an opening for you or another character to escape a situation
*   take +1 forward to escaping a situation
*   choose for the MC when you escape a situation and roll a 7-9

In Sheep's Clothing

When you mislead, distract or trick someone you've previously shared a moment of intimacy with, roll with Heart instead of Mind.

One Way or Another

When you plead with a member of your Circle for help with a pressing situation, roll with Heart. On a hit, they either agree to help or owe you a Debt, their choice. On a 10+, their guilt is palpable: if they decline and owe you a Debt, you take +1 ongoing against them as long as you hold that Debt. On a miss, you are exposed and vulnerable; but if they do agree to help, treat it as if they cashed in a Debt with you that you can't refuse.

### Let It Out Abilities

*   gain access to a secure or locked-down location
*   draw immediate mortal attention to a person or situation
*   spot a previously overlooked clue or advantage in the immediate area
*   convince an NPC to act on their kindness, role, or own best interest

Your Mortal Relationships
-------------------------

While you ride the line between the mortal and supernatural worlds, your friends and family are stuck firmly in the mundane realities of everyday life. **Choose 3:**

A younger sibling who relies on you for transportation and advice

A loyal significant other who expects you home by midnight

A struggling best friend who's always getting into messy altercations

A demanding boss who calls you into work at inconvenient times

An elderly parent who always knows when you're lying to them

An overbearing ex-partner who constantly worries about you

Corruption
----------

**CORRUPTION**

**TRIGGER:** When you ignore your mortal commitments or relationships to deal with the supernatural, mark corruption.

In Too Deep

Mark corruption to get in the way of someone from another Circle as if you rolled a 10+.

If You Can't Beat 'Em

Take one ability from a playbook from another Circle. Whenever you let it out and roll a 12+, mark an additional corruption.

Free Agent

Mark corruption to refuse to honor a Debt owed to someone outside your Circle as if you rolled a 10+

Sticky Fingers

Mark corruption after meeting with a powerful NPC to reveal that you took something of import from them. Mark corruption again to conceal your role in the theft for some time.

The Fae
=======

Fickle and enigmatic, the fae are impossible for a mortal to completely understand. Their ways are steeped in tradition, honor, and, above all else, bargains. They do not simply appreciate these virtues; they embody them.

Fae Moves
---------

**YOU GET THIS ONE:**

Faerie Magic

You have access to gifts of your court, powers that call upon your homeland's magic and wonder. Select your powers from the list provided. Whenever you use a faerie power, choose 1:

*   mark corruption
*   give your monarch a Debt

**AND CHOOSE TWO MORE:**

A Dish Best Served Now

When you commit to enacting revenge on behalf of someone (including yourself) wronged by another, gain +1 ongoing against the target of that vengeance. For every scene in which you do not pursue vengeance after committing to it, suffer 1-harm (ap).

In Our Blood

When you mislead, distract, or trick someone from a different Circle through lies of omission or clever misdirection, roll with Heart instead of Mind.

Scales of Justice

Cash in a Debt with someone to target them using a power from Faerie Magic—including powers not normally available to you—at no additional cost.

Draw Back the Curtain

When you escape a situation, add this option to the list:

*   you escape to your homeland, for better or worse

Words Are Wind

You know instantly if someone has broken their word to you or reneged on a deal you've made; take a Debt on them and +1 ongoing to claim what you deserve from them or their allies until they've made things right.

*   summon an elemental storm of your court (2-harm close area ap)
*   appear to others as someone you have previously touched
*   compel the elements of your court to reveal what they have seen
*   create a telepathic link between yourself and another for a scene

Your Court

**Your court is...**

baroque and formal

savage and unruly

aloof and cold

mysterious and exotic

Faerie Powers
-------------

**CHOOSE THREE:**

Nature's Caress

Your touch heals 2-harm, starting with critical harm; wounds close, bones knit back together, etc. You cannot use this power on yourself.

Wither

You can imbue your touch with the power to kill (3-harm intimate ap). The effect is instantly understood by the target as an attack and leaves behind a nasty mark or scar at the point of contact.

Glamours

You create illusions to fool the senses. The effects don't last long, but they are compelling. You cannot disguise or conceal yourself or your actions with these tricks.

Shape Change

You can change your shape into that of a small animal—a bird, a mouse, a snake, a fish, etc.—for a scene. Up to three people you designate can still understand your speech, but everyone else perceives you to be barking, chirping, etc.

Bedlam

You can touch a vulnerable target to place them in a specific emotional state (your choice) for the scene. Mark corruption to have that emotion directed toward a target of your choosing.

*   You are keeping something hidden on behalf of someone else from a powerful member of their Circle. Ask them why. They owe you a Debt.
*   You entrusted someone with an important and dangerous task. Ask them if they succeeded or failed. If they succeeded, you owe them a Debt. If they failed, they owe you a Debt.

The Hunter
==========

Determined and fearless, the Hunter is a mortal who has taken up a cause against the darkness around them, joining the fight alongside other hunters in the night. They carry a heavy burden, one that would eventually crush anyone. How long can they keep from becoming what they hunt?

Hunter Moves
------------

**CHOOSE THREE:**

Deadly

When you inflict harm, inflict +1 harm. You cannot choose to reduce this harm.

Safe House

*   high-tech surveillance equipment
*   a mystical or magical prison
*   fortified walls/windows/doors
*   stockpiles of food and water
*   explosives set to blow the place

This Way!

When you lead people out of danger, roll with Blood. On 10+, you all get away safely. On a 7-9, you get hurt or one of them gets hurt (your choice). On a miss, everyone's safe but you; you're left behind...and the way out is closed to you.

Worse Things Out Tonight

When you persuade an NPC by promising to protect them from harm, roll with Blood instead of Heart.

Prepared for Anything

You have a well-stocked armory, full of modern and ancient weapons. Take another two custom weapons and select one additional add-on for every custom weapon you own.

Watch them Closely

When you closely observe a supernatural person or creature, roll with Blood. On a hit, the MC will tell you a bit about their nature and at least one unusual weakness or flaw; take +1 ongoing when you take advantage of these unique vulnerabilities. On a 10+, ask a follow-up question, the MC will answer it honestly. On a miss, someone takes advantage of your diverted attention and acts against you before you see it coming.

### Let It Out Abilities

*   track someone or something through the city with limited information or trail
*   treat a mundane object as a weapon (2-harm messy) or 1-armor for a scene
*   jury rig an explosive (3-harm loud fire) or smoke bomb (s-harm loud smoke)

The Imp
=======

Not all demons serve the old masters. Some—known as imps—have stolen their freedom through tricks and loopholes and now juggle their scams and schemes in pursuit of a better life. There are some advantages to being underestimated.

Imp Moves
---------

**YOU GET THIS ONE:**

Business as Usual

When time passes—or at the start of the game—roll with Mind. On a hit, your usual operations generate a new scheme or provide an opportunity to advance one of your existing schemes, your choice. On a 10+, you also pick 1:

*   A loyal customer reveals the secrets of a powerful NPC, your choice
*   An NPC who owes you a Debt shows up to make good on their obligation
*   A Status-3 NPC of your Circle offers you a Debt for your services

On a miss, a family member or close friend drags you into a scheme you'd rather have avoided; generate a new scheme with three complications.

**AND CHOOSE TWO MORE:**

Measure your mark

When you figure someone out, add the following questions to the list:

*   What pressing need do you have that I might be able to address?
*   What's the most valuable thing you'd offer for sale?

On a miss, ask 1 from this list, but you come off as suspicious or sleazy, your choice.

Friends in Low Places

When you get a hit while putting a face to a name with a Status-3 NPC, also name a low-level minion or assistant who works for them and describe how this underling recently came to owe you a Debt.

I'm a Fucking Demon

Ignore all harm the first time someone—or something—inflicts at least 2-harm upon you in a scene. At the end of each scene, clear your Faint harm box.

Weasel Words

When you refuse to honor a Debt by fast-talking your way out of the obligation, roll with Mind instead of the difference in Status. On a hit—in addition to the normal effects—mark your creditor's Circle as though you had honored the Debt.

### Let It Out Abilities

*   sniff out a secret stash, even when expertly concealed or hidden
*   infiltrate a hostile area by appearing unworthy of concern
*   teleport into your establishment from any distance or position
*   inflict 4-harm (ap) on a vulnerable target who underestimates you

Your Establishment
------------------

You once served a powerful demon, but you seized upon a loophole in your contracted fealty and won your freedom. Now you cater to supernatural clientele from all four Circles, securing your place in this world...for now.

### Choose two services you offer:

Transporting and selling otherworldly creatures

Appraising and auctioning magical relics and artifacts

Creating forgeries, disguises, and stolen identities

Providing news, gossip, and rumor to the city at large

Operating a gathering place; name the relevant Circle

Your Schemes
------------

Schemes are risky deals and shady cons designed to expand your business. When you generate a scheme, choose a primary Circle, one of your services, and two complications—the MC will tell you what opportunity you've seized upon.

Corruption
----------

**CORRUPTION**

**TRIGGER:** When you make a deal that endangers your family, friends, or community, mark corruption.

The Oracle
==========

The future is always in motion, like a great river dragging us all to our inevitable ends. There are some who can raise themselves above the surface to see what awaits us, looking into a future both unclear and terrifying. These oracles are blessed with the sight...and cursed by what they see.

Oracle Moves
------------

**CHOOSE TWO:**

Psychometry

When you examine an interesting object, roll with Spirit. On a hit, ask the MC questions from the list below. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 1:

*   what is the history of this object?
*   what bans, wards, or limits are attached to this object?
*   where does this object belong?
*   what secrets or mysteries has this object been privy to?
*   what strong emotions have most recently been near this object?

On a miss, ask 1, but the answers overwhelm you; take -1 ongoing for the scene.

Skim the Surface

When you touch someone and attempt to read their surface thoughts, roll with Spirit. On a hit, ask their player questions from the list below. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7-9, ask 1:

*   who or what are you protecting?
*   what secrets are you currently keeping?
*   what is your hidden pain?

On a miss, you inflict 1-harm (ap) on them and yourself.

Soothsayer

When you turn to your prophetic tools to read someone's future, roll with Spirit. On a hit, the MC will tell you something new and interesting about their destiny. On a 10+, you may ask a followup question; the MC will answer honestly.

Foresight

*   channel a powerful prophecy from beyond concerning a present character

Corruption
----------

**CORRUPTION**

**TRIGGER:** When you offer a false prophecy—or lie about the details of a true one—mark corruption.

The Spectre
===========

Poltergeists, ghosts, spirits—they are our secret fears and unfulfilled dreams, each the echo of one who died. They are the audience for our secret pains and guilty pleasures.

Spectre Moves
-------------

**YOU GET THIS ONE:**

Manifest

Regular people can't sense or interact with you unless you manifest; supernatural creatures and perceptive mortals usually know you're present, but can't affect you without magical tools or special powers. If you wish, you can manifest by spending a few quiet moments concentrating—choose 2:

*   You can be heard
*   You can be seen
*   You can touch and be touched

You may mark trauma to instead choose 1 or all 3.

**AND CHOOSE TWO MORE:**

Won't Be Ignored

When you get in someone's way, take a 10+ instead of rolling. If you mislead, distract, or trick someone with an obvious supernatural display, roll with Spirit instead of Mind.

Ghost Town

When you hit the streets to consult your ghostly contacts, take +1 ongoing to dealing with them. On a miss, you still find a ghost who has what you're looking to get, but they are dangerous or lost, your choice.

Potent

Take +1 Spirit (max +3).

Wall? What Wall?

You always have an opening to escape a situation. You can choose an additional option off the list to bring someone with you, even if they would normally be unable to escape.

### Let It Out Abilities

*   instantaneously travel to one of your anchors, no matter the distance
*   take control of a machine or vehicle by possessing its mechanical form
*   let loose a psychic blast of ectoplasmic energy (2-harm close area ap)
*   follow an ordinary mortal—no matter where they go

Anchors
-------

a family member or inheritor, unaware of your existence

a witness to your death, bound to you by chance or fate

a friendly household pet, constant companion in your unlife

a beloved possession of your youth, passed to a new owner

Vamp Moves
----------

**YOU GET THIS ONE:**

Eternal Hunger

You hunger for human blood, flesh, or emotions; pick one. When you feed on someone, roll with Blood. On a 10+, all 3. On a 7-9, choose 2:

*   You heal 1-harm or take +1 forward
*   You learn a secret about your prey
*   Your prey doesn't suffer 3-harm (ap)

On a miss, your hunger gets the best of you, and everyone suffers.

Always Welcome

Cold-Blooded

When you keep your cool by flouting mortal social conventions and expectations, roll with Blood instead of Spirit.

Keep Your Friends Close

When you figure someone out by helping them indulge a true hunger, take a 10+ instead of rolling. If they are in your Circle, take +1 ongoing to act on the answers to your questions until time passes.

Terrifying

### Let It Out Abilities

*   create an opportunity to escape, ignoring all mortal bindings
*   perform a fantastic feat of vampiric strength or agility

The Wizard
==========

Mages are among the deadliest and most powerful of all humans. Their ability to reshape the world around them grants them tremendous powers. But nothing corrupts quite like power...

Wizard Moves
------------

**YOU GET THESE:**

Channelling

When you channel and collect your magics, roll with Spirit. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 3 and choose 1 from the list below. On a miss, hold 1, but you cannot channel again this scene.

*   Mark corruption

Your hold lasts until you spend it or the scene ends. You can spend it to cast any spell you have as per the spell's details.

Sanctum Sanctorum

When you go to your sanctum for a spell ingredient, relic, or tome, roll with Spirit. On a 10+, you've got pretty much just the thing.

The Wolf
========

Primal, deadly, and awesome. Little in the world can match the werewolf's relentlessness or brute force. Those cursed by a bite or born into a bloodline carry a great fury within them. But fury, like all emotion, can be tempered and forged into something greater...

Wolf Moves
----------

**YOU GET THIS ONE:**

Comes with the Territory

If you are actively patrolling your territory when time passes—or at the start of the game—roll with Blood. On a 10+, your territory is secure and trouble is at a minimum; take +1 ongoing when you hit the streets in your territory. On a 7-9, one of your troubles surfaces (your choice), along with an opportunity to address it. On a miss, or if you aren't attending to your territory, things go south and your troubles are fast and furious.

**AND CHOOSE ONE MORE:**

Alpha Dog

When you persuade an NPC in your territory with threats or promises, roll with Blood instead of Heart.

Reckless

If you jump right into danger without hedging your bets, you get armor+1. If you're leading a group, it gets armor+1 also.

Bloodhound

When you hunt someone down, roll with Blood. On a hit, you know exactly where to find them and can follow their scent until you do. On a 10+, you find them alone or vulnerable; take +1 forward against them.

Mark of the Beast

When you mark a building with your signs or sigils, roll with Spirit. On a hit, you lay claim to the location for the next few days. On a 10+, all 3. On a 7-9, pick 1. At any distance, you can:

*   sense who is in the building at all times
*   control the doors, locks, and windows
*   conceal the building's location or true function

### Let It Out Abilities

*   heal 2-harm instantaneously, starting with critical harm

------------------

By default, you can change into your wolf form—at will—in the sight of the moon: you gain natural weaponry (2-harm), 1-armor, and all of the qualities and weaknesses you choose below.

### Choose 3 Qualities:

You are massive: gain armor+1 and harm +1

You are savage: your harm is armor piercing (ap) and messy

You are versatile: take +1 ongoing to letting it out

You are swift: take +1 ongoing to escaping

You are cunning: take +1 ongoing to keeping your cool

You are steadfast: you fight like a small group against groups

### Choose 3 Weaknesses:

Silver weapons ignore your armor and inflict harm+1

Sometimes you lose control while transformed

Sometimes you transform when you are stressed or angry

The transformation is brief; you shift back at the end of a scene

The transformation is violent and painful; suffer 1-harm (ap)

The transformation draws the attention of supernatural creatures

Your Territory
--------------

You've claimed an area of the city as your own. By default, your territory covers a city block or two and has the trouble: +crime.

Corruption
----------

**CORRUPTION**

**TRIGGER:** When you destroy a threat to your territory instead of driving it out, mark corruption.

Character Creation
------------------

### Starting Stats

Blood 1, Heart -1, Mind 0, Spirit 1

### Starting Circles

Mortalis 0, Night 1, Power -1, Wild 1

### Starting Status

Mortalis 0, Night 1, Power 0, Wild 0

### Starting Gear

A duffel bag with your personal belongings, a shitty cell phone.

Choose two practical weapons:

*   Snubnosed revolver (2-harm close/near loud reload concealable)
*   9mm Beretta (2-harm near loud concealable)
*   Butterfly knife (2-harm hand concealable)
*   Machete (3-harm close messy)
*   Baseball bat (2-harm close stun)

The Sworn
=========

The machinations of Power rely on many to keep the wheels turning, but none so much as those sworn to serve the many factions of Power—academies, abbeys, and councils. Yet no matter what oath underlies their service, those sworn must make their own decisions about control, loyalty, and justice...

Sworn Moves
-----------

**CHOOSE TWO:**

Protect and Serve

When you read a charged situation, roll with Mind. On a hit, ask the MC questions; take +1 ongoing when you act on the answers. On a 10+, ask 2. On a 7-9, ask 1.

*   where's my escape route / way in / way past?
*   which enemy is most vulnerable to me?
*   what should I be on the lookout for?
*   what's my enemy's true position?
*   who here can't be trusted?

On a miss, you recognize a weakness in your own position or preparations you should have seen coming.

Hard to Shake

When you follow an NPC through the streets of the city, roll with Mind. On a hit, where they go, you follow. On a 7-9, you run into some trouble on the way; deal with it quickly or lose the trail. On a miss, your prey leads you exactly where they want you; brace yourself for the closing jaws of the trap.

Devious

Take +1 Mind (max+3).

Genuine Police

When you put a face to a name or study a sanctuary, gathering spot, or place of power, roll with Mind instead of the relevant Circle. You always get to ask the MC an additional question about the person or place in question, even on a miss.

Chess Not Checkers

When you turn to violence with any kind of serious advantage—numbers, position, surprise, etc.—and get a hit, tell your opposition which option they cannot choose from their list before they pick.

### Let It Out Abilities

*   shatter a magical spell, illusion, or enchantment with a touch
*   cloak yourself in magical armor; expend it to ignore all harm one time
*   strike down all lesser foes in your vicinity with a blast of elemental force
*   force someone to answer your questions truthfully for a scene

Your Oath
---------

You've sworn an oath to serve an influential faction of Power, an organization that relies on you to protect its members, punish its enemies, and defend its holdings.

### Your Masters

You serve (choose one):

an abbey of prescient oracles

a council of haughty wizards

an order of secret immortals

an academy of religious scholars

a covenant of earthbound deities

### You are charged with (choose two):

protecting and policing their members

recovering lost artifacts and tomes

investigating threats and problems

destroying those who would thwart them

negotiating with their allies and vassals

Your Vows
---------

When you break one of your vows, mark corruption. When you take a corruption advance, cross out one of your vows—it no longer binds you. **You must... (choose 5):**

...never trespass on another's property

...never strike the first blow

...never lie about your identity or purpose

...never reveal your faction's secrets

...always avoid collateral damage

...always protect members of Power from harm

...always thwart the enemies of your masters

...always seize that which your masters desire

Your Legendary Weapon
---------------------

Your masters have given you a weapon (3-harm mythic anchored) to wield, a legendary artifact of an age long lost. **Choose one:**

a sword wielded by rightful kings (figure someone out)

a spear stolen from heaven itself (let it out)

a staff imbued with stealthy sorcery (escape a situation)

a knife cut from demonic steel (mislead, distract or trick)

an axe forged in the blood of gods (turn to violence)

a hammer blessed by otherworldly magic (keep your cool)

Corruption
----------

**CORRUPTION**

**TRIGGER:** When you break one of your vows or work against your masters, mark corruption.

Ahead of the Game

You get +1 Mind (max+4). Whenever you roll with Mind and roll a 12+, mark corruption.

Stool Pigeons

Mark corruption to roll with Mind instead of the relevant Circle Status when you consult your contacts. On a miss, mark corruption again—then choose to either answer your contact's tough question or owe them a Debt.

Student of the Arts

Choose three Spells. Mark corruption to gain two hold you can use to cast those spells.

Infernal Affairs

When you turn to violence, you may mark corruption to take a 10+ instead of rolling.

Character Creation
------------------

### Starting Stats

Blood 1, Heart 0, Mind 1, Spirit -1

### Starting Circles

Mortalis -1, Night 0, Power 1, Wild 1

### Starting Status

Mortalis 0, Night 0, Power 1, Wild 0

### Starting Gear

A luxurious house or apartment, a fancy car, an expensive smartphone

One backup weapon of choice:

*   9mm Beretta (2-harm near loud concealable)
*   Hunting knife (2-harm hand)
*   Sawed-off shotgun (2-harm close loud reload messy concealable)

### Starting Debts

*   Someone gives you info about a Circle you don't understand. You owe them a Debt.
*   You secretly helped someone get justice for a wrong done upon them. They owe you a Debt. Tell them why you helped.
*   Your service forced you to punish or kill someone's ally or friend on behalf of your masters. You owe them a Debt.

The Tainted
===========

Most tainted remember a time before all this; before their souls ended up in the hands of demons and devils. Now they're something more than just human, working jobs for patrons who are never satisfied, never finished demanding obedience. But a contract is a contract...

Tainted Moves
-------------

**YOU GET THIS ONE:**

The Devil Inside

When you assume your demon form, roll with Blood. On a 10+, pick 3. On a 7-9, pick 2. On a miss, pick 1 and give your patron a Debt...or go without your form.  
  
If you're working a job for your patron, pick 1 more. If you mark corruption, pick 1 more.

*   +demonic weapon (3-harm hand or 2-harm close)
*   +demonic movement (flight, flaming motorcycle, etc.)
*   +demonic senses (infrared sight, smell lies, etc.)
*   gain armor+1
*   heal 2-harm
*   take +1 forward

**AND CHOOSE TWO MORE:**

Invocation

You may cash in a Debt with someone to appear in their presence; others may cash in a Debt with you to have you appear as well. Successfully refusing to honor the Debt cancels the invocation completely.

Tongued and Silver

When you figure someone out by tempting them with power, roll with Heart instead of Mind.

Dark Bargain

When you seal a bargain with someone in smoke and blood, roll with Heart. On a hit, you infuse the agreement with demonic force. On a 10+, pick 2. On a 7-9, pick 1.

*   All parties intuitively know if the deal is being honored.
*   All parties take +1 ongoing to letting it out while fulfilling the deal.
*   Anyone violating the pact instantly suffers 4-harm (ap).

On a miss, the bargain displeases the powers you called upon to sanctify the deal; you must perform an act of contrition before you can invoke their influence again.

Tough as Nails

You get 1-armor; blessed or holy sources ignore this armor completely. Weapons designed to stun or impair you have no effect unless blessed or holy. You don't require medical attention or magical assistance to heal harm you've suffered, and you clear critical harm like it was faint or serious harm—one box every few days.

### Let It Out Abilities

*   imbue your touch with demonic corruption (2-harm hand ap)
*   impress, dismay, or frighten someone with a display of demonic fury
*   move through or past a physical obstacle created by mortal hands
*   summon your dark patron's attention directly on your location

Your Dark Patron
----------------

Your soul has fallen into the hands of a dark patron, a powerful demon whose reputation precedes them, but whose true name is known to few. They have given you terms of employment, access to terrible power, and terrifying insight into their true nature.

### Choose 2:

they seduce all who come into contact with them with pleasantries, gifts, and vices

they govern their sprawling organization through strict and severe rules and punishments

they require deference from their minions to their strange obsession with a mortal pastime

they manipulate their friends, allies, and enemies alike into conflicts that serve their secret designs

they have seeded eyes and ears across the city, always alert to any sign of betrayal or profitable opportunity

they employ only dedicated and loyal minions who are all too happy to report on your activities

they are slow to anger, but their commitment to their wrath is unstoppable once truly provoked

Your Demon Form
---------------

Since your patron claimed your soul, you have a new look: a demon form. Pick as many as apply from the lists below:

**Head:** bone, concave, crown, flames, halo, horns, spikes

**Eyes:** absent, animal, empty, glowing, smoky, un-blinking

**Limbs:** claws, heavy, hoofed, many, severed, twisted

**Wings:** blood, feathers, insects, leather, metal, paper, none

**Skin:** chitinous, marked, misty, sticky, stretched, translucent

Demonic Jobs
------------

Your dark patron keeps you on Earth for a reason; they could always have decided to drag you to hell. Choose two jobs you regularly do for them:

Collecting souls

Tracking down rogue demons

Delivering threats and messages

Cleaning up gruesome messes

Guarding someone or something

Destroying your patron's enemies

Brokering demonic contracts

Hiding and securing demonic contraband

Operating a demonic establishment

Policing your patron's minions

Corruption
----------

**CORRUPTION**

**TRIGGER:** When you convince someone to meaningfully act in your patron's interests, mark corruption.

Just Below the Surface

Mark corruption to assume your demon form without a roll and gain all the options listed.

Not to Be Denied

When someone rolls a hit while refusing to honor a Debt you've cashed in on them, you may mark corruption to make their roll a miss instead.

From Hell

Mark corruption to have your patron send a small gang of demons to work on your behalf for a scene (2-harm 2-armor savage demonic).

I'm a Hustler, Baby

Mark corruption to make an additional city move when time passes; if you use your Circle Status for the move, add +1 to your roll.

Character Creation
------------------

### Starting Stats

Blood 1, Heart 1, Mind -1, Spirit 0

### Starting Circles

Mortalis 1, Night -1, Power 0, Wild 1

### Starting Status

Mortalis 0, Night 0, Power 0, Wild 1

### Starting Gear

A house or apartment, a car, a smartphone.

One brutal weapon of choice:

*   Truncheon (2-harm hand stun)
*   9mm Beretta (2-harm close loud concealable)
*   Pump-action shotgun (3-harm close/near loud reload messy)
*   Sword (3-harm hand messy)

### Starting Debts

*   You're protecting someone from a dark power, a rival and enemy of your demonic patron. Your charge owes you a Debt.
*   Someone is trying to save you from damnation and keeps suffering for it. Ask them why they care when no one else does. You owe them a Debt.
*   You hurt or killed someone's good friend or ally on your demonic patron's orders. You owe them a Debt.

The Veteran
===========

Once upon a time, you were someone important...and dangerous. People knew you and gave you a wide berth. You were a force to be reckoned with in this city. And then you got old, broken, or both.

Veteran Moves
-------------

**YOU GET THIS ONE:**

Old Friends, Old Favors

When you first encounter an NPC, you may declare them an old friend instead of putting a name to a face and roll with Mind. On a hit, they offer you aid, even if it exposes them to danger. On a 7-9, tell the MC why you owe them a Debt. On a miss, tell the MC why they probably bear an old grudge against you for wronging them in the past.

**AND CHOOSE TWO MORE:**

True Artist

When you publicly present a valuable or rare gift you've created to a Status-2+ NPC, they must openly refuse or accept your offering. If they refuse, they owe you a Debt; if they accept, take +1 ongoing to consulting your contacts, recruiting allies, and refusing to honor Debts from their Circle until after time passes.

Invested

When someone owes you 2 or more Debts and you lend them a hand or get in their way, roll with Mind instead of Circle.

Too Old for This Shit!

When you get caught up in a fight you tried to prevent, you get armor+1 and take +1 ongoing to seeing yourself and others to safety.

The Best Laid Plans

When you work out a plan with someone, roll with Mind. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. You can spend your hold—1 for 1—regardless of distance, while the plan is underway to:

*   Add +1 to someone's roll (after rolling)
*   Dismiss all harm someone suffers from a single attack
*   Ensure your people have the exact gear they need on hand

On a miss, hold 1, but your plan encounters some disastrous opposition right from the start.

Gun to a Knife Fight

When you turn to violence against someone by seriously escalating the conflict, roll with Mind instead of Blood.

### Let It Out Abilities

*   blindside an unsuspecting target with a terrible or knockout blow
*   barricade or secure a place using minimal supplies
*   frighten or intimidate someone with a reminder of the person you used to be
*   reveal the ways an old ally or enemy is shaping a current conflict

Your Workshop
-------------

You have a workshop that includes a large space for your tools and/or supplies. When you go into your workshop to work on something, the MC tells you requirements like time, materials, or assistance needed.

Items created in your workshop are safe from the MC. They can't be destroyed or taken without your permission, even if you sell or give them away to another character.

### Choose and underline 3 resources your workshop includes:

automotive hoist and tools

a darkroom

a regulated growing environment

two or three skilled assistants

a junkyard of raw materials

machining tools

transmitters and receivers

a testing ground

deadly booby traps

a library of old books

a scattering of ancient relics

a mystical focus

magical wards

a medical station

an operating room

high-tech electronics and computers

an advanced surveillance system

a forge

a science lab

a portal to another dimension

Corruption
----------

**CORRUPTION**

**TRIGGER:** When you knowingly head straight into danger, mark corruption.

Back At It

Take two abilities from another playbook. When you let it out to use these abilities, you cannot choose to avoid corruption on a 10+.

Pack Rat

You may mark corruption to reach into your kit and find just the gear you need to deal with your current situation.

Catch You Fuckers At A Bad Time?

Mark corruption to arrive in a scene. Mark an additional corruption to bring someone willing with you.

Dark Experiments

When you work over someone (alive or dead) in your workshop, mark corruption to ask up to two questions about their weaknesses or secrets. They must answer honestly.

# Urban Shadows City Hubs Reference

## Art District

*In the Art District, colors swirl, pop, and blister; Wild thrives here, tip-toeing the line between artistic passion and corporate assimilation. Buskers stand on street corners with nothing but their aspirations and a beat up guitar case, while the wealthy rub shoulders with overworked gallery owners and preening artists. Dreams are the currency of the art district...just be careful not to let yours fall into the wrong hands.*

| | Your artwork has been showing up in prestigious galleries...but you weren't the one to put it there. ____________________ was the only one aside from you to have access to your work. How do you plan to confront them? |
| | You've been supplying ____________________ with an illicit magical substance for some time now. Why have you started altering the composition and how did they find out? |
| | You admire ____________________ from afar. It started out as admiration for their work, but now some might call you obsessed. What personal item have they discovered you stole from them? |
| | You dated ____________________ for years until they sold you out to powerful vampires. Why are both of you scheduled to testify in front of those same vampires this week? |

| | ____________________'s art is hauntingly similar to that of your sibling, who you thought died years ago, and little things they say make you think they know more than they're letting on. What leverage do you plan to use to get them to tell you the truth? |

### Hub Moves

#### COME TOGETHER
When you organize a protest, roll with a Circle of your fellow organizers. On a hit, your protest puts pressure on a powerful NPC of your choice; they take a -1 ongoing through the next faction turn. On a 10+, the leader of another faction takes interest in your cause and delivers a Debt, powerful resources, or secret information that aids your cause. On a miss, someone you trusted leaks your secrets to a dangerous foe.

#### CHAOS IS A LADDER
When you posture for clout in front of well-connected NPCs, roll with Mind. On a hit, they buy your ruse; take +1 Status with a relevant Circle until time passes or your deception is revealed. On a 7-9, they require you to prove yourself or risk retribution. On a miss, your humblebragging attracts the attention of a rival to whom you owe an uncomfortably large Debt; take -1 ongoing when refusing to honor your Debts to anyone from their Circle until time passes.

#### PROMISES, PROMISES
When you persuade an NPC by promising concrete assistance in pursuing their dreams, mark corruption to take a 10+ instead of rolling. If you cannot fulfill your promise by the end of the next session, mark another corruption.

## City Hall

*The red tape of bureaucracy binds all; Mortalis holds sway in City Hall by knowing where the tape is weakest—and who needs to be cut to walk past it. By day, ordinary politicians do "the work" of "the people;" by night, scheming fae make deals behind warded doors and immortal powerbrokers wait in empty parking garages to have their say. You can't fight city hall, but someone with influence can always pencil you in for the right price.*

| | You and ____________________ were placed on a mundane jury by a Status-3 member of your Circle to covertly secure a guilty verdict against someone's mortal pawn. What did you do when you learned the accused is innocent? |

### Hub Moves

#### THE PRICE OF SECRETS
When you blackmail a powerful NPC with proof of their dirty deeds, roll with your Status in their Circle. On a hit, hold 2. On a 10+ hold 3. Spend your hold—1 for 1—as if spending a Debt (asking for a moderate favor, adding +3 to your roll when persuading them, etc.) when interacting with your target. Once you've used the last of your hold, take -1 ongoing to moves targeting them until time passes. On a miss, they call your bluff and make you, or your source, pay.

#### PROPER FORMS AND LICENSES
When you bury someone in messy paperwork by manipulating city officials, roll with Heart. On a hit, you draw unwanted municipal attention to their dealings; they take -1 ongoing to moves during the faction turn until they return to anonymity. On a 10+, you convince your agents at city hall that you're doing them a favor; take a Debt on them as well. On a miss, your machinations are both costly and impotent; a Status-3 NPC takes an interest in your schemes as well as a result of your incompetent meddling.

| | You've recently fallen for a successful shop owner downtown, but you haven't ended your relationship with ____________________ yet. Why are you hesitant to break things off, even though the spark is gone? |
| | While doing some delivery work for a few of the more popular demonic eateries downtown, you caught ____________________ in a scandalous situation. What did they offer to buy your silence and why is it still not enough? |

### Hub Moves

#### UP FOR GRABS
When you smash and grab something useful from the streets or shops downtown, name what you're after and roll with Blood. On a hit, you take what you want by force. On a 7-9, you spot someone who will make trouble for you leaving the scene with evidence of your wrongdoing. On a miss, you get your hands on something close to what you wanted, but the victim of your theft takes it personally; one of your close allies becomes an additional target of their ire until time passes.

#### BAR BUDDIES
When you go drinking downtown in the hopes of networking with the wealthy and powerful, roll with Heart. On a hit, you meet just the person—someone connected to an NPC of your choice; the MC will tell you who they are. On a 10+, you get along famously; you can count them among your friends and they (drunkenly) agree to one favor you ask. On a 7-9, they are a bit more cautious, only scratching your back if you scratch theirs; take a +1 ongoing to persuade them to help you out if you agree to a small favor before you roll. On a miss, you overindulge in whatever vice plagues you most; the MC will tell you how your foolish needs get you in over your head.

## University

*The University is a hotbed of political discourse, supernatural research, and strange magical phenomena. Power holds an iron grip over this section of the city—controlling the institutions that determine the city's very future—but plenty goes on in the shadows they can't reach. The wizards and immortals might think they control destiny, but the city's history is often written by those with more mundane hungers...*

### Hub Moves

#### A FRIEND IN THE SCIENCE DEPARTMENT
When you hit the streets to look for information about strange or magical phenomena by consulting your university contacts, you can roll with Mind instead of Circle when you consult your contacts at the university. On a miss, your questions attract the attention of an old enemy looking to settle a score.

#### WELCOME TO MY OFFICE
When you perform a ritual to secure a secluded place on campus for a meeting or deal, roll with Spirit. On a hit, the campus bends to your will and produces a secure location only available to you and those you designate; it lasts until the meeting or deal is complete. On a 10+, the place is quietly attuned to you; you never have to mark corruption when you let it out within. On a miss, your attempt to warp reality to suit your needs results in something dangerous piercing the veil between worlds.

#### LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS
When you set up a new program, business, or enterprise to accomplish your goals, spend up to three Debts; hold 1 for each Debt spent. When time passes, you can spend your hold—1 for 1—to take a +1 (or give a +1 to another PC or faction) on any city or faction move aided by your new endeavor.

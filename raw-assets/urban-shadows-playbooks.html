    <!-- THE AWARE -->
    <section class="playbook-description">
        <h1 class="playbook-title">The Aware</h1>
        <p class="playbook-intro">Most people have no idea what takes place in the shadows of the city, remaining ignorant of the monsters that walk among us. Those awakened to the world as it truly is can't help but feel the pull of the darkness...</p>

        <h2>Aware Moves</h2>
        <p><strong>CHOOSE THREE:</strong></p>

        <div class="move">
            <p><span class="checkbox"></span> <span class="move-name">I Know a Guy</span></p>
            <div class="move-description">
                When you hit the streets to get what you need from a member of your Circle, roll with Heart instead of their Circle. On a 7-9, add this option to the list:
                <ul class="abilities-list">
                    <li>however you find them requires you to offer a Debt to an intermediary</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="move">
            <p><span class="checkbox"></span> <span class="move-name">Charming, Not Sincere</span></p>
            <div class="move-description">Take +1 Heart (max+3).</div>
        </div>

        <div class="move">
            <p><span class="checkbox"></span> <span class="move-name">The Lion's Den</span></p>
            <div class="move-description">
                When you gain access to a secure area within a sanctuary, gathering spot, or place of power, you can study it as if you rolled a 10+. If the location is controlled by a Circle other than your own, you also find incriminating evidence implicating a powerful NPC (your choice) within that Circle; handing the documents over to them—or one of their enemies—counts as cashing in a Debt.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="move">
            <p><span class="checkbox"></span> <span class="move-name">This is My City</span></p>
            <div class="move-description">
                When you set up a meeting with a powerful or dangerous individual in a crowded mundane space (museum, restaurant, etc.), hold 2. You can spend your hold, 1 for 1, to:
                <ul class="abilities-list">
                    <li>create an opening for you or another character to escape a situation</li>
                    <li>take +1 forward to escaping a situation</li>
                    <li>choose for the MC when you escape a situation and roll a 7-9</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="move">
            <p><span class="checkbox"></span> <span class="move-name">In Sheep's Clothing</span></p>
            <div class="move-description">
                When you mislead, distract or trick someone you've previously shared a moment of intimacy with, roll with Heart instead of Mind.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="move">
            <p><span class="checkbox"></span> <span class="move-name">One Way or Another</span></p>
            <div class="move-description">
                When you plead with a member of your Circle for help with a pressing situation, roll with Heart. On a hit, they either agree to help or owe you a Debt, their choice. On a 10+, their guilt is palpable: if they decline and owe you a Debt, you take +1 ongoing against them as long as you hold that Debt. On a miss, you are exposed and vulnerable; but if they do agree to help, treat it as if they cashed in a Debt with you that you can't refuse.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Let It Out Abilities</h3>
        <ul class="abilities-list">
            <li>gain access to a secure or locked-down location</li>
            <li>draw immediate mortal attention to a person or situation</li>
            <li>spot a previously overlooked clue or advantage in the immediate area</li>
            <li>convince an NPC to act on their kindness, role, or own best interest</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Dark Patron</h2>
        <p>Your soul has fallen into the hands of a dark patron, a powerful demon whose reputation precedes them, but whose true name is known to few. They have given you terms of employment, access to terrible power, and terrifying insight into their true nature.</p>
        
        <h3>Choose 2:</h3>

            <div><span class="checkbox"></span> they are slow to anger, but their commitment to their wrath is unstoppable once truly provoked</div>
        </div>

        <h2>Your Demon Form</h2>
        <p>Since your patron claimed your soul, you have a new look: a demon form. Pick as many as apply from the lists below:</p>
        
        <div style="margin: 15px 0;">
            <p><strong>Head:</strong> bone, concave, crown, flames, halo, horns, spikes</p>

On a hit, they either agree to help or owe you a Debt, their choice. On a 10+, their guilt is palpable: if they decline and owe you a Debt, you take +1 ongoing against them as long as you hold that Debt. On a miss, you are exposed and vulnerable; but if they do agree to help, Otreat it as if they <em><strong>cashed in a Debt</strong></em> with you that you canâ€™t refuse.</p>",

When one of your mortal relationships comes to an end for any reason—they cut you off, they die, they leave the city, you tell them to stop contacting you, etc.— immediately mark a corruption advance. If losing a mortal relationship causes you to retire your character due to corruption, tell the MC whom you most blame for the loss; your character will pursue the person responsible as a Threat until “justice” is served.",
